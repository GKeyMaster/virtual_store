<h2 align="center">About 📖</h2>
   
<p align="center">
   This is the Virtual-Store (an e-commerce) developed with Flutter 💙 and Firebase 💛.<br>
   This application has very good features that made me learn a lot more about Flutter and Firebase, togheter with all the challenges I had, that made me learn even more.<br>
   I will talk more about the application in the topic "Functionalities 🛠️", and my experience with it in the topic "Challenges and Learnings along the way 🤯".<br>
   This that can be easily implemented as an MVP (and feel free to do that) 😀.<br>
   This application was develop for <a href="https://instagram.com/normaltda">@normaltda</a>, a store located in my hometown, Uruburetama.

<h2 align="center">Challenges and Learnings along the way 🤯</h2>

   <p>
    This application was quite complex and with many challenges from the beginning, it was the most time-consuming and complicated I have ever made. 💪<br> 
    A very interesting thing a that I used was the packpage <a href="https://pub.dev/packages/effective_dart">effective_dart</a>, which will help me to put good practices in the Dart language, it is a very useful tool, and it helps quite. See more <a href="https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart">here</a>.<br>
    My experience with Flutter and Firebase increased a lot after this app, it was challenging and that in the middle of the way there were a lot of mistakes, which further increased my curiosity and desire to learn more.<br>
    I learned a lot about Firebase, and I loved its speed of action and structuring. Some mistakes were a little silly, but they made me be more attentive, like a simple space after creating a field haha. <br>
    In the last push on GitHub, I realized that the application was not yet complete, and I found that I had two folders with the same name and application, one was complete, and the other was not, and it took me a while to complete it and set it up it again.<br>
    I was also having a problem logging in users, and I realized that the error was in the as signup_screen folder, it was fixed, and the problem was resolved.<br>
    There were many learnings, and that I will take all of them to my career. 🚀
